== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can i hide a social media icon that i not using? =
To hide a social media icon, Just don't give any value for that icon link.. it will automatically gets hidden.

= Why the floating social media icon is not displaying on my page even if i made all properly? =
Our Plugin Uses Hooks to integrate the supported javascripts styles and html to the theme. So Make sure your theme **footer.php** have  **&lt;?php wp_footer(); ?&gt;** and **header.php** have  &lt;?php wp_head(); ?&gt; , Most of all the plugins work with the support of this code and if this is not present on your theme.. Its your themes mistake..

= How can i integrate the  &lt;?php wp_footer(); ?&gt; and  &lt;?php wp_head(); ?&gt; to my theme if it is not present on my theme? =
It can be easily done.. Just to go Theme Editor which is under appearance and select footer.php and add  &lt;?php wp_footer(); ?&gt; before the closing body tag which is  **&lt;/body&gt;** and then go and edit header.php and add &lt;?php wp_head(); ?&gt; just before the closing head tag which is  **&lt;/head&gt;**

= Can i disable the automated integration and place where ever i want? =
Yes, You can.. Just to go **"Acx Social icons"** Menu which is in left side on wp-admin and in that page you will find "Display Mode" option. Select it to Manual. But then there will be no animation but you can Use Our Shortcode or PHP Code to display the social media icons anywhere you want.

= What are the shortcode and php code that will display this social media icon? =
You can use the shortcode  **[DISPLAY_ACURAX_ICONS]** in any post or page or even in your custom post types. You can also use  **&lt;?php DISPLAY_ACURAX_ICONS(); ?&gt;** anywhere in the theme files to show this icons.(But note that manual icons display will not have the animation

= Can i have more than one php or shortcode to display the social media icon ? =
Yes, You can have as many shortcode or php code to display the social media icons

= Can i choose any social media icon for widget? =
You can choose social media icon style, size, for each widget configuration so that you can have different style of icon in sidebar or footer widgets.

= How can i hide a social media icon from the list? =
If you want to hide a particular social media icon, you just make the configuration field for that social media service blank and it will not be shown.

= Can i override the css styles of each social media icon set? =
Yes, each of the shortcode or php generated social media icon set is having unique css class and it help you to define specific style for each social media icon set.

= Can i customize the shortcode to show social media icons with different icon design and size? =
Yes, You can use shortcode to display icon and set social media icon size,what ever you want which is supported by the plugin. You can override the global icon theme and size configuration using some attributes on shortcode.

As you know we have given icon themes, Numbers to identify. Right now we have themes like, 1,2,3,4....

If you want to show icons with Theme # 5, You can use the shortcode **[DISPLAY_ACURAX_ICONS theme="5"]**
Here we using the attribute **"theme"** to define the theme number (Make sure you use the available theme numbers, You can see the theme numbers on plugin settings page)

If you want to show the icons with a custom size 50px.. you can use the shortcode **[DISPLAY_ACURAX_ICONS size="50"]**
Here we using the attribute **"size"** to define the icon size (Make Sure you specifying size which is not more than "55" which is the maximum icon support of this plugin, **DO NOT ADD px**, Just Add the Size in Numerical)

So if you use a shortcode **[DISPLAY_ACURAX_ICONS theme="10" size="45" align="left"]**
It will show the Social Media Icon with Icon Theme 10 and Icon size will be 45px width and height and it aligns to left.

= Why are my social media icons show vertically? =
Floating Social Media Icon displays social media icons with its own style, but in some cases, some theme css styles can override the styles of the social media icons generated by floating social media icon and thats what causing the issue.

= Can i fix the social media vertical align issue? =
Depending on the theme, the issue can happen, for this case, we have added a theme conflict fix in misc page, please enable it and take a look.
